* **Problem Objective**
    * The main aim is to help the client Sigma Cabs to become a full fledged cab aggregator by building a production level model based on the 'Surge_pricing_type' target variable which was calculated by the clients themselves based on the experience in the taxi industry for last 10 months.

    * We were able to acheieve a f1-weighted score of 0.81 with a bias error around 19%. We used stacking model as the final model
